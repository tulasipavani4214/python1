1.) What makes NumPy.shape() different from 
NumPy.size()?
• NumPy.shape() :- NumPy arrays have an attribute 
called shape that returns a tuple with each index 
having the number of corresponding elements
• NumPy.size() :- size() Function in Python. The size 
of an array is the total number of elements in the 
array. The NumPy.size() function in the NumPy 
package returns the size of a given array.
• Difference :- NumPy.shape() is used to get 
complete structural shape of our 2D array. For 
example (3,4). NumPy.size() will give us how many 
elements are present in total
2.) In NumPy, describe the idea of broadcasting
• The term broadcasting refers to the ability 
of NumPy to treat arrays of different shapes 
during arithmetic operations. Arithmetic 
operations on arrays are usually done on 
corresponding elements. If two arrays are of 
exactly the same shape, then these 
operations are smoothly performed3.) What makes Python better than other libraries 
for numerical computation?
• Numerical Python has a fixed-size, 
homogeneous (fixed-type), multi-
dimensional array type and lots of functions 
for various array operations. The result is a 
dynamically typed environment for array 
computing similar to basic Matlab.
• We can use a lot of numerical libraries 
which can solve any mathematical problem
• Also Python can solve any special numerical 
modules be used to solve numerical 4.) How does NumPy deal with files?
• NumPy introduces a simple file format for 
ndarray objects. This . npy file stores data, 
shape, dtype and other information 
required to reconstruct the ndarray in a disk 
file such that the array is correctly retrieved 
even if the file is on another machine with 
different architecture
5.) Mention the importance of NumPy.empty().
• The empty() function is used to create a 
new array of given shape and type, without 
initializing entries. Shape of the empty 
array, e.g., (2, 3) or 2. Desired output data-
type for the array, e.g, numpy. int8
problems as well.
• All the above points we discussed makes 
makes Python better than other libraries for
